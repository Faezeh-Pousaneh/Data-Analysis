Executable:   /sw/sdev/Modules/gromacs/gromacs-2016.1/bin/gmx
Data prefix:  /sw/sdev/Modules/gromacs/gromacs-2016.1
Working dir:  /home/ntnu/pousaneh/Simulations/Confiremd/AR_HS_2019/P9000
Command line:
  gmx grompp -f NVT2.mdp -c NPT.gro -p topol.top -o NVT2.tpr -maxwarn 3 -t NPT.cpt

Replacing old mdp entry 'nstxtcout' by 'nstxout-compressed'

Back Off! I just backed up mdout.mdp to ./#mdout.mdp.1#

NOTE 1 [file NVT2.mdp]:
  The group cutoff scheme is deprecated since GROMACS 5.0 and will be
  removed in a future release when all interaction forms are supported for
  the verlet scheme. The verlet scheme already scales better, and it is
  compatible with GPUs and other accelerators.


NOTE 2 [file NVT2.mdp]:
  The Berendsen thermostat does not generate the correct kinetic energy
  distribution. You might want to consider using the V-rescale thermostat.

Setting the LD random seed to 43561700
Generated 168 of the 1653 non-bonded parameter combinations
Excluding 1 bonded neighbours molecule type 'AR'
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group System is 2997.00

WARNING 1 [file NVT2.mdp]:
  You are using full electrostatics treatment PME-User for a system without
  charges.
  This costs a lot of performance for just processing zeros, consider using
  Cut-off instead.


Reading Coordinates, Velocities and Box size from old trajectory
Will read whole trajectory
Last frame         -1 time 60000.000   
Using frame at t = 60000 ps
Starting time for run is 0 ps
Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.25

  Hardware topology: Basic


The current CPU can measure timings more accurately than the code in
mdrun was configured to use. This might affect your simulation
speed as accurate timings are needed for load-balancing.
Please consider rebuilding mdrun with the GMX_USE_RDTSCP=ON CMake option.

NOTE: This file uses the deprecated 'group' cutoff_scheme. This will be
removed in a future release when 'verlet' supports all interaction forms.
